# YARN Scheduler UI - Simplification Status

**Started**: January 2025  
**Purpose**: Track progress of simplification plan implementation

## Implementation Progress

### Step 1: Remove Unused Code ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Low | **Risk**: Low

**Completed:**
- [x] Remove DiffManager.js file (removed ~133 lines)
- [x] Remove DiffManager.js script include from index.html  
- [x] Remove denormalizeResource() method from SchedulerDataCache (~28 lines)
- [x] Remove commented console.warn in QueueTreeView.js

**Impact**: Reduced codebase size (~161 lines), removed confusion, cleaner script loading

---

### Step 2: Simplify Validation Pipeline ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: High | **Effort**: Medium | **Risk**: Medium

**Completed:**
- [x] Created unified QueueValidator.js (146 lines) replacing 5 separate files
- [x] Consolidated single-pass validation logic for all queue properties
- [x] Updated SchedulerConfigModel to use QueueValidator
- [x] Removed ValidationPipeline.js, CapacitySumValidator.js, QueueNameValidator.js, NodeLabelValidator.js, QueueStateValidator.js
- [x] Updated index.html script includes

**Benefits**: ~254 lines removed (400 old - 146 new), single-pass validation, better performance

---

### Step 3: Architectural Unification ⏸️ PENDING
**Priority**: Critical | **Effort**: High | **Risk**: High

**Target**: Replace SchedulerConfigTrie + ChangeLog with unified QueueConfigurationManager

**Benefits**: ~300 lines reduction, eliminates duplicate data structures

---

### Step 4: Optimize Rendering Pipeline ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Risk**: Medium

**Completed:**
- [x] Eliminated legacy format conversions in ViewDataFormatterService (3 locations)
- [x] Updated _buildEffectiveProperties to handle ChangeLog format directly
- [x] Lowered virtual scrolling threshold from 50 to 20 queues
- [x] Removed ~36 lines of conversion logic across multiple methods

**Benefits**: Eliminated conversion overhead during rendering, earlier virtual scrolling, cleaner code

---

### Step 5: Controller Refactoring ⏸️ PENDING  
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Risk**: Medium

**Target**: Extract services from MainController to follow SRP

---

### Step 6: Error Handling Simplification ✅ COMPLETED
**Priority**: Medium | **Effort**: Medium | **Risk**: Low

**Completed:**
- [x] Merged ConfigurationError functionality into ValidationError
- [x] Reduced error types from 5 to 4 (YarnSchedulerError, ApiError, ValidationError, ErrorHandler)
- [x] Consolidated error message handling and user-friendly messages
- [x] Updated all references to use ValidationError instead of ConfigurationError
- [x] Removed ConfigurationError.js file (~70 lines)

**Benefits**: Simplified error hierarchy, reduced complexity, unified validation/configuration error handling

---

## Overall Progress

- **Steps Completed**: 4/6  
- **Lines Removed**: 521/1000 (target: 20% reduction) - 52% complete!
- **Files Modified**: 0
- **Files Removed**: 0

## Notes

- Starting with low-risk items to build confidence
- Following implementation order from SIMPLIFICATION.md
- Tracking all changes for potential rollback

## Bug Fix: Capacity Sum Validation with Mixed Modes

**Issue**: Capacity sum validation was incorrectly flagging errors when sibling queues used mixed capacity modes (e.g., one queue with weight "4w" and another with percentage "10%").

**Root Cause**: The validator was including weight-based queues in percentage sum calculation and requiring all siblings to sum to 100%, even when mixed modes were present.

**Fix**: Updated `QueueValidator._validateNode()` to:
- Only apply percentage sum validation when ALL siblings are percentage-based
- Skip validation for mixed mode scenarios (percentage + weight + absolute)
- Allow mixed resource types as supported in YARN's non-legacy mode

**Result**: Mixed capacity modes now work correctly without false validation errors. ✅ Confirmed working by user testing.

## Bug Fix: Bulk Operations Checkbox Synchronization

**Issue**: "Select All" and "Clear All" buttons in bulk operations updated internal selection state but didn't sync individual queue card checkboxes.

**Root Cause**: The `selectionChanged` event only updated the selection count display, not the individual checkbox states.

**Fix**: Added `_updateCheckboxStates()` method to `BulkOperationsView` that syncs all checkbox states when selection changes programmatically.

**Result**: Individual checkboxes now properly reflect selection state when using "Select All" or "Clear All" buttons.

## Summary of Completed Work

### Significant Achievements:
1. **Removed 521 lines of code** (52% of target) 
2. **Eliminated duplicate logic** across multiple components
3. **Improved performance** with single-pass validation and early virtual scrolling
4. **Simplified architecture** by consolidating related functionality
5. **Enhanced maintainability** through cleaner, more focused code

### Files Removed:
- DiffManager.js (133 lines)
- ValidationPipeline.js + 4 validators → QueueValidator.js (net -254 lines) 
- ConfigurationError.js (70 lines)

### Files Modified:
- ViewDataFormatterService.js: Eliminated legacy format conversions
- QueueTreeView.js: Lowered virtual scrolling threshold 
- SchedulerDataCache.js: Removed unused denormalizeResource method
- ValidationError.js: Consolidated error handling
- Multiple files: Updated imports and references

### Performance Improvements:
- Single-pass validation instead of 4 separate validators
- Virtual scrolling activates at 20 queues instead of 50
- Eliminated conversion overhead during rendering
- Cleaner error handling with unified messaging

## Remaining Work

Two major steps remain:
- **Step 3**: SchedulerConfigTrie/ChangeLog unification (high complexity but high value)
- **Step 5**: MainController refactoring (medium complexity, good for maintainability)

Both would benefit from careful planning and gradual implementation.
